# push

A micro front-end framework built for speed and purity

## intro

push is similar to react + redux, however there is no virtual dom diffing.   
Instead you have control over what components get rendered by using a treeReduce function - making things extremely fast.

push comes with:
- routing
- redux-like state management
- treeReduce re-rendering

## install

The easiest way to install is to create a new project directory and then install from a seed project

javaScript

```
npx douglas get push-seed

```
